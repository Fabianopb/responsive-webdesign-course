# responsive-webdesign-course 

I developed this website following the course <a href="http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Creating-Responsive-Web-Design/424046-2.html" target="_blank">"Create a Responsive Web Design" with Chris Converse at Lynda.com

The techniques are simple and involve the use of html just to structure the content and plain css to deal with different screen sizes and also for creating a template for printing the page in a nice way.
